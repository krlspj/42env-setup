# 42correction-env
Are you tired of dealing with subpar Vim configurations from other users?  
I'm working on simplifying the process of setting up my Neovim configuration on campus computers and providing a way to remove it completely without leaving a trace.  
**To run the script**
```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krlspj/42env-setup/main/42correction-env/setup_neovim.sh)"
```
